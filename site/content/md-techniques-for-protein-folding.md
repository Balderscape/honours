This year I am completing an Honours year in Theoretical Chemistry at Sydney University. The main aim of the research is to develop new molecular dynamics (MD) methods to improve the speed at which proteins can be folded computationally. The general approach will be to introduce additional spatial dimensions into the force fields used which should reduce the number of minimums present in the potential energy surface (PES). The MD simulation can then progress to find the global minimium and following this the simulation can be projected back into 3D.

The projection back into 3D is not guaranteed to settle on the global minimum for the 3D PES, however I will explore techniqus to improve the likelyhood of the projection back to 3D space hitting the global minimum.
