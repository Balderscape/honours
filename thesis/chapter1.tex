\chapter{Introduction}
Your introductory chapter. This should provide a framework for the rest of 
your thesis. It should introduce the context of your research and its 
importance. You should discuss previous work in the field and appropriate 
methodology for your project. Ideally your introduction should also spell out:
\begin{enumerate}
\item what you want to do
\item why it is important
\item how you are going to do it
\end{enumerate}

\section{Specific Aims}
You may like to use sub-headings for background, methodology and aims. You may 
also like to provide a paragraph at the end of the introduction outlining the 
structure of your thesis.
