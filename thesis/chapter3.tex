\chapter{Comparison of Path Integral Methods}\label{Chapter:Three}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter compares the different path integral formalisms derived in 
Chapter \ref{Chapter:Two}. Here you can think of it as a combined ``Results 
and Discussion'' chapter. You may prefer separate chapters. Again, you should 
orient your reader in terms of what to expect from the chapter.
\\\\
\section{Path Integral Method 1}
You should present your results logically. You can divide this Chapter up any 
it makes sense to you (and ideally to make the  most sense to your reader). 
You should include sufficient detail to reproduce your results.
\\\\
\section{Path Integral Method 2}
You should use figures and tables to help reinforce your main points. For 
example, Figure  shows the refinement of Chin action 
path integral parameters for water. These have been includes as pdfs but you 
can use other formats.
\\

\section{Conclusions}
You may like to include a separate conclusions for this Chapter, or for each 
subsection of the chapter.
